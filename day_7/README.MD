# --- Day 7: Laboratories ---
Part 1 was easy and quick, Part 2 broke my brain. It took me way longer than im willing to admit, to understand that the naive solution for part 2 literally takes 2^~1500 branches and therefore isn't viable.  
The next morning I was able to get an idea of how I can solve it, and that worked out well.
